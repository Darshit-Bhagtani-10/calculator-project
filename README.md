# calculator-project
This is the first project I created independently after practicing smaller projects. 
The project is a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even modulus using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project was created approximately 5 months ago but was uploaded later than planned due to unforeseen circumstances.
